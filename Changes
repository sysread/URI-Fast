0.51 ????-??-??
-feature: new constructor, new_abs($rel, $base)
-feature: abs() aliased to absolute()
-feature: rel() aliased to relative()
-feature: canonical() aliased to normalize() (this was true in prior versions, but undocumented)
-feature: normalize() now decodes unreserved chars and normalizes + to %20 (RFC 3986, 6.2.2.2)
-feature: TO_JSON() added as alias of to_string()
-miscellaneous minor efficiency/speed improvements

0.50 2021-08-03
-behavior: correct uri_split and uri to treat leading double-slash in input
 string as the beginning of the authority section, as URI and URI::Split do,
 instead of as the beginning of the path with ad leading empty segment
-feature: new subroutine html_url, which scrubs whitespace permitted by URLs
 read from HTML documents (tab, newline, carriage return) and replaces
 backslashes with forward slashes (also allowed in HTML, I'm afraid)

0.49 2019-08-02
-make 0.48_01 official

0.48_01 2019-07-31

-bugfix: fix dynamically set $VERSION in URI::Fast::IRI

0.47 2019-07-05
-bugfix: escape_tree and unescape_tree die when called with non-reference
 argument
-workaround: an older release had a versioned URI::Fast::IRI, requiring that it
 remains versioned to keep the cpan indexer happy; this change works around
 that by linking it to $URI::Fast::VERSION.
-bugfix: path([]) caused infinite loop, because why would av_top_index return 0
 for an empty array anyway?
